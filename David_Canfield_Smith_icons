An icon is a graphical entity that has meaning both as a visual image and as a machine object. Icons control the execution of computer programs, because they have code and data (text) associated with them, as well as their images on the screen. After completing my thesis, I joined Xerox's "Star" computer project. The icon idea has subsequently been adopted by the entire personal computer and workstation industry.
