We got some funding in the early sixties, I think it was from NASA, and set up an experimental environment with several different kind of devices; a tracking ball, a light pen, and things of that sort that were available at the time. As we were setting the expirements, I happened to remember some notes that I had made in a pocket notebook some years before, and I sketched that out to Bill English, who was the engineer setting up experiments, and he put up a mouse together, with the help of few draftsmen and machinists. That one was put in the experiments, and happened to be winning all the tests. That became the pointing device for our user interface. Somebody, I can't remember who, attachex the name "mouse" to it. You can picture why, becuase it was an onbject about this big, and had one button to use for selection, and had a wire running out the back.
