There are three stages in the use/development of a technology. The first stage is the enthusiast stage, people don't care if the technology is easy or hard to use because they are so excited by the technology itself or by what it will do for them. They want it, however diffcult it is to use. The second stage is the professional stage, when those who use the technology are often not those who buy it. The thisrd and last stage is the consumer stage. People now are less interested in the technology in itself than in what it can do for them. They don't want to spend much time learning how to use it, otherwise they don't buy it.
