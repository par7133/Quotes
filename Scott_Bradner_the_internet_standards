The motto of IETF is "rough consensous and running code". A proposal doesn't require the full consensous of the working group but 90% of the votes. Indeed, if the proposal only reach 80% of the support is discarded. Starting as a "Proposed standard", the proposal is tested and completed till to reach, after six months, the status of "Draft standard". From Draft standard, after four months, it will become an Internet standard.
