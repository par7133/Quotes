For the test we had naive users coming in, and we explained everything that would happen so that they weren't surprised. We asked them to put their hands on the keyboard, and all of sudden an array of three-by-three object would appear at an arbitrary place on the screen, sometimes small objects and sometimes large, and they had to hit a space bar, access the pointing device and go click on it. The computer measured time, overshoot, and any other characteristics we thought were valuable. The assessment just showed the mouse coming out ahead among all the pointing devices.
